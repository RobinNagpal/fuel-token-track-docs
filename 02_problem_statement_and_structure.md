# TokenTrack Project
One of the most common use cases for smart contracts is to create a token. In this example, we will create a contract 
that can mint, burn, and track the balance of a token for a user. We will also create a frontend that will allow us 
to interact with the contract.

- Mint tokens
- Burn tokens
- Transfer tokens
- Check the balance of a user or a wallet
