# TokenTrack Project

## ToDo

- Explain the problem statement for token track
- What tools we will be using (both on the frontend as well as the backend).
- Explain the structure of the project, the directory structure.
  There shall be a single folder containing the contract code as well as the frontend code. We shall initialize the forc project using the `forc new â€¦ ` command. The frontend React code shall be initialized using the `npx create react-app` command.
